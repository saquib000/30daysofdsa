Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = {}
        cond=len(nums)/2
        for i in nums : 
            dic[i]=0

        for i in nums:
            dic[i]+=1

        for j in dic:
            if dic[j] >= cond :
                return (j)
