Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in dic.keys():
                dic[num] = 1
            else:
                dic[num] += 1

        for num in dic:
            if dic[num] == 1:
                return num
